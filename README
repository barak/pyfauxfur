README
======

This file provides explanations regarding the PyMorphogenesis project.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This program has been tested with python 2.5. It requires PyQt4, NumPy,
SciPy and pyglet. It has been tested with PyQt4 4.4.4, NumPy 1.2.1,
SciPy 0.7.0 and Pyglet 1.1.2.

INSTALLATION
------------

Apart from the dependencies, no installation should be necessary.

If Ui_MainWindow.py has not been generated, you can do so by running

	./gen.sh

USAGE
-----

Simply run

	python PyMorphogenesis.py

For additional usage information, you can run

	python PyMorphogenesis.py --help

You can also generate a batch of sample images after 1000 iterations with

	./test_images.sh

SOME PATTERNS
-------------

The default parameters (which you can see with the --help option) are a good
starting point for interesting textures. Running the program for 1000 or so
iterations with parameters within [0.5, 2] * default values will produce
interesting results. Changing ÃŸ_i is not recommended.

To get stripes, use D_a > 10 * D_b, the width of stripes will decrease when
D_s increases. To obtain dots, use 5 * D_b > D_a > 3 * D_b. To obtain blobs
and lines, use D_a >> D_b. The spots will be less intense as the number of
iterations and D_s increase.
